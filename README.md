# 2D_spaceshooter_unity
The files here are all C# scripts which i have created for my 2D space shooter game.
Each file is a code for different game objects that are in game ,you can know the file the game object is attache to , by name of that file.
for example ,file "player.cs" is the code which is used to give behaviour for in game player object,same goes for all files with thier respective 
objects.
